Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of fraud datasets, advanced preprocessing and model evaluation strategies were applied to improve detection performance.

The project was developed as part of a capstone assignment, demonstrating practical implementation of data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.


📊 Dataset
Source: ULB Credit Card Fraud Dataset
Total Transactions: 284,807
Features: 30 (including anonymized features V1–V28, Time, Amount)
Target Variable:
0 → Normal transaction
1 → Fraudulent transaction


⚙️ Project Workflow
🔹 Week 1: Setup & Data Loading
Environment setup using Anaconda
Required libraries installed
Dataset loaded into Pandas DataFrame
Initial data inspection performed

🔹 Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary statistics generated
Class imbalance identified
Data visualization (histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmap)
Data quality checks (missing values, duplicates, outliers)

🔹 Week 3: Data Preprocessing
Missing values handled (none found)
Duplicate records checked and removed
Outliers treated using IQR and capping
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Class imbalance handled using SMOTE
Feature engineering (Amount_capped)
Dataset split into training, validation, and test sets

🔹 Week 4: Model Development & Evaluation
Implemented multiple models:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest ✅ (Best Model)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection)
Evaluated models using:
Confusion Matrix
Precision, Recall, F1-score
Performed feature importance analysis

🧠 Model Performance Summary
Model	Performance
Random Forest	⭐ Best performance (high precision & recall)
Logistic Regression	Moderate performance
SVM	Poor performance (convergence issues)
Isolation Forest	Moderate (useful for anomaly detection)
🏆 Final Model Selection
Random Forest was selected as the final model due to its strong ability to:

Detect fraudulent transactions accurately
Maintain a balance between precision and recall
Handle complex patterns in the dataset
🔍 Key Insights
The dataset is highly imbalanced (~0.17% fraud cases)
Feature importance analysis revealed key variables influencing fraud detection
SMOTE significantly improved model performance
Ensemble models outperform simpler models for fraud detection
🚨 Real-World Application
This model can be integrated into real-time financial systems to:

Monitor transactions continuously
Flag suspicious transactions instantly
Trigger alerts for fraud investigation
Reduce financial losses due to fraud
